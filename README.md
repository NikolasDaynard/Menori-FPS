# g3d_fps
Work in progress code, not meant to really be a public-facing library right now.

A 3D first-person controller with physics written in Lua using my [g3d](https://github.com/groverburger/g3d) 3D engine for Love2D.
Contains many efficient collision functions, and the player uses a capsule collider which allows it to interact with walls, floors, and slopes of any angle correctly.
